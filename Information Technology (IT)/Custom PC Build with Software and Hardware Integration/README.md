# Custom PC Build with Software and Hardware Integration

## Overview
In this project, I built a custom PC from scratch by carefully selecting and assembling components. This hands-on experience deepened my understanding of hardware assembly, software configuration, and system performance optimization.

## Scenario
To prepare for a career in IT, I aimed to gain practical knowledge of hardware compatibility, system configuration, and troubleshooting by assembling a PC, installing the operating system, and configuring software for peak performance.

## Steps Taken
1. **Component Selection**
  - After thorough research, I selected components that were compatible, cost-effective, and performance-focused:
    - **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X 6-core, 12-thread processor
    - **GPU**: Zotac Gaming GeForce RTX 3060
    - **RAM**: Corsair Dominator Platinum RGB 16GB (2x8GB)
    - **Storage**:
      - SAMSUNG 970 EVO Plus SSD 500GB (M.2 NVMe)
      - SAMSUNG 990 PRO SSD 1TB (PCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe)
    - **Motherboard**: ASUS ROG Strix B550-A
    - **Power Supply**: Cooler Master V750 SFX Gold White Edition
    - **Case**: Lian Li Dynamic Mini-White
    - **Cooling**: NZXT Kraken Z53 240mm RGB AIO Liquid Cooler
    - **Fans**: Corsair SP120 RGB Performance Fans (9), managed via Corsair iCUE Commander Core XT
    - **Peripherals**: Monitor, keyboard, mouse, speakers, and headset for system use and testing

2. **Hardware Assembly**
  - Installed components into the Lian Li case, including CPU, GPU, RAM, storage devices, and cooling system.
  - Managed cables for power, data, and RGB lighting with attention to airflow and aesthetic presentation.
  - Connected nine fans to the Corsair iCUE Commander Core XT for integrated control of fan speed and lighting.

3. **System Setup and Configuration**
  - Installed Windows 10 and completed updates to ensure system stability.
  - Configured BIOS settings, including fan profiles and basic overclocking.
  - Installed essential drivers for the GPU, motherboard, and other hardware.
  - Set up productivity software (e.g., Microsoft Office), security features (BitLocker, firewall), and performance-monitoring tools.

4. **Testing and Troubleshooting**
  - **CPU Replacement** - Initial power-up failed due to bent CPU pins, which caused motherboard issues. Replaced the defective CPU, resolving the problem.

  - **Internet Connectivity** - Wi-Fi on the motherboard failed despite antenna installation. Used an Ethernet cable for initial configuration, enabling Wi-Fi functionality afterward.

  - **GPU Connection Issue** - GPU was not recognized. After consulting online resources and contacting the manufacturer, I identified a defective motherboard. Replacing the motherboard resolved the issue.

  - **Fan Installation Challenges** - Limited motherboard fan headers required the use of a PWM Fan Hub Splitter for power. To enable RGB lighting, I added a Corsair iCUE Commander Core XT for full functionality.

  - **USB Port Limitations** - The motherboard's USB ports were insufficient for all peripherals and fans. Installed an EZDIY-FAB USB3.1 Gen2 Internal 20-pin Expansion Card, which provided additional ports for connectivity.

## Conclusion
This project provided in-depth, hands-on experience with PC hardware and software, including component compatibility, system optimization, and troubleshooting. These experiences developed my ability to assemble, configure, and maintain computer systems, preparing me for entry-level IT roles where hardware support and system troubleshooting are essential.
